A project for cse 332 - Data Structure and Algorithms. 

Implemented various worklists and tries along with a program that zips files. 

Implementation of the following data structures:
    Worklist ADTs:
      - LisstFIFOQueue
      - ArratStack
      - CircularArrayFIFOQueue

    Tries:
      - HashTrieMap
      - HashTrieSet
